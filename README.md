# Spam Checker
A machine learning program designed to differentiate between spam and regular emails using a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features (Multinomial Naive Bayes model), in this case being the email's text content. 

This program uses the following libraries:

**pandas** : Used to load and manipulate data in this program, it provides high-performance data structures and data analysis tools.

**sklearn** : Used to convert text into numerical feature matrix, then split data into test and training data, then generate a model and lastly check accuracy, it is another data analysis library and is greatly used for Machine Learning(ML).
